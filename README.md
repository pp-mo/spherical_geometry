spherical_geometry
==================

2d points and polygons on a unit sphere

NOTES: 
 * Primary purpose is calculation of areas of overlap of spherical polygons : Only implement what is needed for that.
 * Various tests included.
   * testing presently depends on Iris.tests (https://github.com/SciTools/iris/tree/master/lib/iris/tests)
   (which is hardly ideal).
